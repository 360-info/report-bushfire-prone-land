These data are used to inform\nplanning, risk and building decisions. The implementation of this instrument varies considerably state to state. \n\nThis visualization shows the proportion of bushfire prone land in each Australian suburb.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A map of Australian suburbs showing the proportion of land area classified as Bushfire Prone Land by the relevant state authority.

The image on the left shows the bushfire prone land categories (see below table). The image on the right overlays the historical burned area polygons. Notice the strong correlation (at least visually) between high risk bushfire prone land and actual land impacted by recent fire activity.  Lower risk areas are much less impacted.    \n\n![](img/360_bfp.png)  \n\n\nCategory | Description | Risk Rating  \n------|-----------\nVegetation Category 1 |  Areas of forest, woodlands, heaths (tall and short), forested wetlands and timber plantations. | High\nVegetation Category 2  | Rainforests. Lower risk vegetation parcels. These vegetation parcels represent a lower bush fire risk to surrounding development and consist of: - Remnant vegetation; - Land with ongoing land management practices that actively reduces bush fire risk | Low  \nVegetation Category 3 | Grasslands, freshwater wetlands, semi-arid woodlands, alpine complex and arid shrublands. | Medium  \nBuffer | Buffers are created based on the bushfire vegetation, with buffering distance being 100 metres for vegetation category 1 and 30 metres for vegetation category 2 and 3. |   \n\n\n\n",
